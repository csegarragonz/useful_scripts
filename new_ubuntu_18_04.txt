This is a guide to installing a fresh new Ubuntu 18.04 (minimal) @ CSEM. I assume that you have a USB that has been burned with an image of the LTS, and that you have already contacted UDITIS to have a new Linux PC name.

1. Insert USB and restart the PC. While restart alternatively press F8 and F12 on a Lenovo machine. Hopefully you will enter the special boot mode.

2. If so, press enter where you see the bootable USB (you can navigate between diferent options using arrow keys).

3. Once booted, choose install Ubuntu.

4. It is important that in the Computer's Name field you put the one given by UDITIS. Username and password do not really matter.

5. Install the minimal option allowing all the third-party drivers.

6. Complete all the other fields at will. No Wi-Fi connection for the moment.

7. At this point I assume that you have finished installing Ubuntu, rebooted, removed the USB and are succesfully logged in to your brand new Ubuntu account. You are one step closer to dumping Windows.

8. First thing you have to do is set up the Wi-Fi connection:
    - Settings (top right corner)
    - Wi-Fi
    - CSEM-WLAN -> Click
        Security: WPA2 Enterprise
        Authentication: PEAP
        Anonymous identity: (none)
        CA certificate: (none)
        Inner authentication: MSCHAPv2
        Username: <CSEM identifier>
        Password: <CSEM's pass>

9. Now install a couple of things
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks git curl cifs-utils vim-gnome pass openjdk-8-jdk scala blueman network-manager-openconnect-gnome
snap install spotify
snap install --clasic slack
snap install telegram-desktop

10. Now set up the VPN connection
    - Settings
    - Network
    - VPN (Add)
        - Name: CSEM
        - VPN Protocol: Cisco AnyConnect
        - Gateway: vpn.csem.ch

11. Now you should change a line in a random file
    - sudo vim /etc/nsswitch.conf
    - In line 12, dns should be the second element. This is, after files and before mdns4_minimal

12. Configure a fast way home
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id carlos@carlossegarra.com
scp carlos@carlossegarra.com:csg_bup_files/config ~/.ssh/

13. To set up your password store
ssh carlos
gpg --export-secret-keys carlos@carlossegarra.com > pkey.asc
exit
cd ~
mkdir .password_store
scp carlos:pkey.asc .
gpg --import pkey.asc
rm pkey.asc
git init
git remote add origin carlos:git/keys/
git pull origin master
// Should be working now

14. Now you should be able to log in to Github and then 

11. Now you should obtain (from somewhere) the certificate to access to CSEM's privat github. Once you have the file:
    - Open Firefox
    - Preferences
    - Privacy & Security
    - Certificates > View Certificates > Import > Select the file
